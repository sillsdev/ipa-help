IPA Help

IPA Help is a windows desktop application that allows the user to learn, explore and be tested on all things IPA.
The application was originally developed with VB6.  The implementation was dependent on the Sheridan Software DataWidgets control, which is no longer provided.  

The source code code for the project has been migrated to VS2017, but no work has been done to remove the original dependency on the Sheridan control.  
The code will compile with many warnings, and will run, but is not fully functional or tested.

The project has been retargeted to use .NET 4.5.2

Visual Studio 2017 requires the use of Visual Basic PowerPack for VS2015 - located here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/developing-apps/windows-forms/power-packs-controls

The original VB6 source files are stored on the VB6 branch for reference only.

The application is deployed with non-open source audio and data files.  These files are not included in this repository.
