IPA Help

IPA Help is a windows desktop application that allows the user to learn, explore and be tested on all things IPA.
The application was originally developed with VB6.  The implementation was dependent on the Sheridan Software DataWidgets control, which is no longer provided.  

The source code code for the project has been migrated to VS2010, but no work has been done to remove the original dependency on the Sheridan control.  The code to presently compile, but has many errors.

The application is deployed with non-open source audio and data files.  These files are not included in this repository.
